# The-Horrible-Bad-No-Good-Event-Song-Suggester

## Problem
We want users to experience music as it comes through in their daily lives, defined as events.

## Solution

By creating “The Horrible, Bad, No Good, Event Song Suggester”, we’re able to provide users with a song that reflects their current feelings based on their environment.

## Success Criteria

A simple webpage(web app) that allows the user to input an event within a given text box.
The output will be defined in multiple stages:

1. Output the song title and artist (maybe with metadata)
    * This will be on the same webpage
2. Give the user the option to play the song in the browser.
    * Authorizing the user
    * Looking into spotify playback integration
3. Give them the option to reverse search for a song that is opposite of the mood that their event might entail.
4. Integrate user functionality where they would be able to save previous searches.

## Requirements
Users are able to submit an event in sentence form and the system is able to return a song that corresponds with their event.
